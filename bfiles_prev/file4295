visit civil battlefield this year appropriately named chancellorsville virginia where confederate general thomas stonewall jackson lost life friendly fire relevant choice osborne wounded last week friendly fire from another battle looming when fund sends team officials britain next month give economy annual inspection unless next batch data starting with first quarter growth numbers this week provides strong evidence that last started recover sustainably fund will urging osborne provide boost demand this doesn necessarily mean will call publicly treasury abandon plan tighten fiscal policy this year that likely recommendation unless osborne find alternative expanding demand unsurprisingly chancellor mightily unhappy that singled country that needed rethink approach public spending part that because fund initially four square behind government austerity plan part because osborne good relationship with fund managing director christine lagarde first finance minister endorse when running part because chancellor thinks already done quite underpin economy including budget help housing market part because osborne believes quite correctly that there other countries more deserving kicking from could certainly have done without intervention week that unemployment rise second credit downgrade debunking seminal paper carmen reinhart rogoff that been used fiscal conservatives including osborne justify austerity significance infamous paper that struck chord when published arguing that growth rates fell sharply when nation debt proportion annual output reached manna from heaven those policy makers keen take immediate tough action tighten fiscal policy result basic spreadsheet errors clear that debt cliff does exist moreover ensured wider hearing those economists have always been sceptical about thesis simply counter argument that have confused cause effect countries have high debt levels because they have slow growth rather than having slow growth because they heavily indebted this seems logical britain debt ratio more than doubled past five years close level collapse economy followed most tepid recoveries that blew hole government finances there indication that servicing this debt prohibitively expensive indeed interest rates government gilts close historic lows they other countries such germany that running debt ratios similar size message simple economies moving debt will look after itself unfortunately there slightest indication washington last week that policy makers knew this indeed spat between britain fund helped enliven what would

their fingers crossed that unprecedented monetary policy easing will eventually work while harbouring fears that aftermath great recession could growth high unemployment equilibrium sort seen since there however marked reluctance voice this fear openly despite revising down forecasts fund said encouraged improvement financial market conditions believed that global economy mend privately however presented alternative risk scenarios which faster than expected recovery leads central banks unwinding their colossal monetary stimulus quickly another which growth continues disappoint leading rising debt levels both public private sectors things stand second scenario looks more likely three global economy growth engines have their problems recovering more quickly than most advanced countries
